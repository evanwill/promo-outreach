## About the Collection

This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/).

At the moment, it is simply a handful of promotional items to help West Virginia libraries get the word out about resources on WVInfoDepot.org. It was created for an ALA Workshop. It is not meant to be used at this time but may be updated for public release in the future.
